The first thing that I decided to do was to set up a dictionary for the values that we needed along with setting up some initial values.
The next thing I decided to do was to set up and read the master input list. The next thing I had to do was figure out how to get the
neccesary data from each file.I then set up a process file function that would take the file we needed from the master file
list. Here in the process file fucntion I needed to set local variable values to get the data we needed such as distance ran
and the number of appearences of each person in each file. Then after all of the files were processed I grouped all of the
data together to find the global max and min and the total distance each person ran and the distance ran in total for all of the files
and the appearances/total appearences. I then printed it and wrote the data that was requested into an output file that would be sent out
once the program was completed. I made sure to always close the files and program once they where done to avoid any error.
